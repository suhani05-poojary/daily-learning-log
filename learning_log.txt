Today I uploaded all the remaining files of the Family Expense Prediction Machine Learning project to my GitHub repository. 
This included the Python program files, dataset files, trained model file, and frontend file.
I checked the repository to make sure all files were uploaded correctly and properly organized.

Through this process, I improved my understanding of managing project files and maintaining a complete machine learning project on GitHub.
